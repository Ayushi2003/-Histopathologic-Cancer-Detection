One key challenge is that the metastases can be as small as single cells in a large area of tissue.\n\n### How would a solution look like?\n\n**Our evaluation metric is [area under the ROC curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic).** The ROC curve is a plot of *True positive rate* against *False positive rate* at various thresholds and the area under the curve (AUC) is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one. The best possible solution would yield an AUC of 1 which means we would classify all positive samples correctly without getting any false positives. \n\n![ROC curve example](https://i.ibb.co/mBKh6ZB/roc.png)\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> ROC curve from a previous run of this kernel </p>\n\n### What is known about the domain?\n\n**The histopathological images are glass slide microscope images of lymph nodes that are stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).** This staining method is one of the most widely used in medical diagnosis and it produces blue, violet and red colors. Dark blue hematoxylin binds to negatively charged substances such as nucleic acids and pink eosin to positively charged substances like amino-acid side chains (most proteins). Typically nuclei are stained blue, whereas cytoplasm and extracellular parts in various shades of pink.\n\n**Low-resolution**             | **Mid-resolution**            | **High-resolution** \n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n![](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/site/CAMELYON17/serve/public_html/example_low_resolution.png) | ![Example of a metastatic region](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/site/CAMELYON17/serve/public_html/example_mid_resolution.png) | ![Example of a metastatic region](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/site/CAMELYON17/serve/public_html/example_high_resolution.png)\n**[<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> Example of a metastatic region in lymph nodes, CHAMELYON17 </p>](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Background/)**\n\nLymph nodes are small glands that filter the fluid in the lymphatic system and they are the first place a breast cancer is likely to spread. Histological assessment of lymph node metastases is part of determining the stage of breast cancer in TNM classification which is a globally recognized standard for classifying the extent of spread of cancer. The diagnostic procedure for pathologists is tedious and time-consuming as a large area of tissue has to be examined and small metastases can be easily missed.\n\n**Useful links for background knowledge**\n- [Patch Camelyon (PCam)](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam)\n- [Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue and cell sections](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21356829)\n- [H&E-stained sentinel lymph node sections of breast cancer patients: the CAMELYON dataset](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/7/6/giy065/5026175)\n- [CAMELYON16 - background](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/Background/)\n- [CAMELYON17 - background](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Background/)\n- [TNM classification](https://www.uicc.org/resources/tnm)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"49742aee-c292-4031-84a6-11130e99f3c8","_cell_guid":"2e7e7838-4b7f-4e57-8073-f95b2bcf5dfe","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"----------------------------------------------\n# Data understanding\n### What data do we have available?\n\n**220k training images and 57k evaluation images.** The dataset is a subset of the [PCam dataset](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam) and the only difference between these two is that all duplicate images have been removed. The PCam dataset is derived from the [Camelyon16 Challenge dataset](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/Data/) which contains 400 H&E stained whole slide images of sentinel lymph node sections that were acquired and digitized at 2 different centers using a 40x objective. The PCam's dataset including this one uses 10x undersampling to increase the field of view, which gives the resultant pixel resolution of 2.43 microns.\n\nAccording to the data description, there is a 50/50 balance between positive and negative examples in the training and test splits. However, **the training distribution seems to be 60/40 (negatives/positives)**. A positive label means that there is at least one pixel of tumor tissue in the center region (32 x 32px) of the image. **Tumor tissue in the outer region of the patch does not influence the label.** This means that a negatively labeled image could contain metastases in the outer region. Thus, it would be a good idea to crop the images to the center region.\n\n**Image file descriptors**\n\nDescription | \n:--------:|:-------:\nFormat | TIF\nSize | 96 x 96\nChannels | 3\nBits per channel | 8\nData type | Unsigned char\nCompression | Jpeg\n\n### Is the data relevant to the problem?\n\nThis dataset is a combination of two independent datasets collected in Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen, the Netherlands), and the University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, the Netherlands). The slides are produced by routine clinical practices and a trained pathologist would examine similar images for identifying metastases. However, some relevant information about the surroundings might be left out with these small-sized image samples.\n\n### Is it valid? Does it reflect our expectations?\n\nAccording to the data description, the dataset has been stripped of duplicates. However, this has not been confirmed by testing.\n\n> For the entire dataset, when the slide-level label was unclear during the inspection of the H&E-stained slide, an additional WSI with a consecutive tissue section, immunohistochemically stained for cytokeratin, was used to confirm the classification.\n- [1399 H&E-stained sentinel lymph node sections of breast cancer patients: the CAMELYON dataset](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/7/6/giy065/5026175)\n\n### Is the data quality, quantity, recency sufficient?\n\n> All glass slides included in the CAMELYON dataset were part of routine clinical care and are thus of diagnostic quality. However, during the acquisition process, scanning can fail or result in out-of-focus images. As a quality-control measure, all slides were inspected manually after scanning. The inspection was performed by an experienced technician (Q.M. and N.S. for UMCU, M.H. or R.vd.L. for the other centers) to assess the quality of the scan; when in doubt, a pathologist was consulted on whether scanning issues might affect diagnosis.\n- [1399 H&E-stained sentinel lymph node sections of breast cancer patients: the CAMELYON dataset](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/7/6/giy065/5026175)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c7111f85-1728-411f-bd49-8ed25e6de37e","_cell_guid":"a697bffd-d29d-42b8-b3e8-e086c55a2814","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"-----------------------------------------\n# Data visualization"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"89acd6b6-1f66-47d4-a9c0-3b97a0b1f9f2","_cell_guid":"5cd293af-f4f2-4a8e-bb7b-3c14880275e9","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport cv2\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\nimport random\nfrom sklearn.utils import shuffle\nfrom tqdm import tqdm_notebook\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/train_labels.csv')\ntrain_path = '/kaggle/input/train/'\ntest_path = '/kaggle/input/test/'\n# quick look at the label stats\ndata['label'].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7da05675-da21-4d18-b6dc-b7616922643b","_cell_guid":"95232031-fe9e-4859-82e3-09dca60c0248","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that the negative/positive ratio is not entirely 50/50 as there are 130k negatives and 90k negatives.
